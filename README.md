# Megabus Ticket Scraper

date.


# Quantum Simulator - Coming Soon to rohanchugh.com/quantum-simulator

This is a quantum simulator that accepts valid QASM files and computes the quantum state based on the gates within the file, allowing you to choose an integer number of shots to fire and viewing the number of shots for each predicted outcome.


## Usage

Create a QASM file either by using IBM Quantum Composer or in a text document and upload it to the website. If the file is valid, it will display the quantum state and then ask for a number of shots. Enter the number of shots and press fire to view the counts for each predicted outcome.
